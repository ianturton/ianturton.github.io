[This is an old project](https://github.com/ianturton/spatial-cluster-detection) that [Andy Turner](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.turner/) and I collaborated on sometime ago. When Google Code closed I pulled it over to github as it might be useful one day.

It implements a variety of spatial cluster detection methods such as GAM, Besag &amp; Newell, Random circles using [GeoTools](http://geotools.org). There is an initial attempt at a GeoServer WPS process but I'm not sure it will still work.

If you are thinking but I have a heatmap plugin that already works you need to consider the following [XKCD cartoon](http://xkcd.com/1138/) :

![Why Heatmaps are bad!](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heatmap.png "Why Heatmaps are bad!")\
    Why Heatmaps are bad!

And if you feel then need for something more authorative than XKCD see what the [CartoNerd](http://cartonerd.blogspot.co.uk/) has to say about [heat maps](http://cartonerd.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/when-is-heat-map-not-heat-map.html). Hint he's against.
