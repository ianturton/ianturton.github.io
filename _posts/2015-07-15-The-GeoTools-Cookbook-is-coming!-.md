title: The GeoTools Cookbook is coming! 
---

I'm pleased to be able to announce that I have signed a contract with Locate press to write the GeoTools Cookbook. The plan is to complete the book in the next year, so you should be able to buy it at FOSS4G'16 in Bonn. 

Keep watching this blog to see upcoming items and snippets that will appear in the book and if there is any thing that you would particularly like to see in a cookbook then let me know.
