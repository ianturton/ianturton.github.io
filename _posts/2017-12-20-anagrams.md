A little while ago [Alasdair
Rae](https://twitter.com/undertheraedar/status/940308258916585474)
asked if any one had combined an anagram engine with a list of place names.

Well, no one stepped forward so I thought it could be a fun project. And, it
turns out it is quite fun though I got to think about data structures rather
more than geography, but that is probably good for me. 

I made the assumption that Alasdair was probably not interested in just
permutations of letters but wanted actual words (such as would be used in a
crossword clue). I also limited my search to single word anagrams as I can't see
a simple solution to finding multi word solutions.

First I stuffed the Ordnance Survey's OpenNames data set into PostGIS (as who
wants to be scanning hundreds of little csv files). 

I then set up a [GeoTool's](http://geotools.org) [PostGIS
datastore](http://docs.geotools.org/stable/userguide/library/jdbc/postgis.html) and grabbed the populated places.

~~~~java
    Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.DBTYPE.key, PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.DBTYPE.sample);
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.USER.key, "username");
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.PASSWD.key, "password");
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.SCHEMA.key, "opennames");
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.DATABASE.key, "osdata");
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.HOST.key, "127.0.0.1");
    params.put(PostgisNGDataStoreFactory.PORT.key, "5432");

	  DataStore ds = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(params);
    if (ds == null) {
      throw new RuntimeException("No datastore");
    }
    SimpleFeatureSource fs = ds.getFeatureSource("opennames");
    SimpleFeatureCollection features = fs.getFeatures(CQL.toFilter("type = 'populatedPlace'"));

I tried a naive approach of recursively finding every anagram possible from the name and looking each one up in a `HashMap` of English words. Oddly, this took a
long time so I thought (and Googled) some more and came up with the much more
efficient way of sorting the letters in a word and using that as a key to all
words that contained those letters. Then I could sort each place name's letters
and do a single lookup to find all the possible words that could be made with
those letters. That speeded things up nicely.

To build the lookup table I made use of Google's `HashMultimap` (from
[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)) which allows you to create a `Map` of
`Collections` keyed on a `String`.

~~~~java
  private Map<String, Collection<String>> dict;

  public AnagramLookup() throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
    //change this to point to your dictionary (one word per line)
    File f = new File("/usr/share/dict/british-english");
    HashMultimap<String, String> indexedDictionary = HashMultimap.create();
    try (BufferedReader buf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(f))) {
      String line;
      // read each word in the dictionary
      while ((line = buf.readLine()) != null) {
        //strip out non letters
        String word = line.toLowerCase().replaceAll("\\W", "");
        //store the word against the sorted key
        indexedDictionary.put(sort(word), word);
      }
    }
    dict = indexedDictionary.asMap();
  }
~~~~

Then all that is left to do is to iterate each populated place, grab it's name
and then remove all the non-letters and sort it's letters and look the anagrams
in the `HashMap`. The final trick is to remove the name itself if it appears in
the list of anagrams (i,e. the name itself is an English word).

~~~~java
try (SimpleFeatureIterator itr = features.features()) {
      
      while (itr.hasNext()) {
        
        SimpleFeature f = itr.next();
        String name = (String) f.getAttribute("name1");

        current = name.toLowerCase().replaceAll("\\W", "");
        Collection<String> anagrams = getAnagrams(current);
        
        if(anagrams!=null&&!anagrams.isEmpty()) {
          //remove the name itself if it happens to be a word
          anagrams.remove(current);
          if(!anagrams.isEmpty()) {
            results.put(name, new TreeSet<String>(anagrams));
          }
        }
      }
    }
~~~~

Results
-------

It turns out that there are 6 11 letter anagrams for the list of GB place names.

+ Balnadelson - belladonnas
+ Fortis Green - reforesting
+ Gilling East - legislating
+ Green Plains - spenglerian
+ Morningside - modernising
+ Sharrington - harringtons
+ Stone Corner - cornerstone


A [Spenglerian](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Spenglerian)
is "of or relating to the theory of world history developed by
Oswald Spengler which holds that all major cultures undergo similar
cyclical developments from birth to maturity to decay". While a
[Harrington](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/harrington)
is "a man's short lightweight jacket with a collar and a zipped front."

Other highlights for cross word setters include Aimes Green as menageries and
Westlinton as tinseltown. 

I have posted the [full list of anagrams](https://gitlab.com/snippets/1689724) and the [code to generate the
