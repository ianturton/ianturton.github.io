# FOSS4G 2019 Review

Or "What Ian did on his holidays" - I had the good fortune to attend
FOSS4G in Bucharest this year. I also had the fun of driving across Europe
(and back again) but more of that later.

This post is partly to let people know what I found useful and interesting at
the conference and partly (mostly) a reminder for my future self about useful
talks. This year we also have **all** the talks available as videos already up
for everyone to view. This is great because each year I promise myself I will 
go back and watch the video of talks I had hoped to see live but missed for some
reason or other, but somehow by the time the videos are available I've forgotten
or just never seem to get around to it.

First, the compulsory self promotion - I gave two
talks at the conference. The first was about some
work I did in [my day job](https://astuntechnology.com)
which used WPS to make life easier for web map users, you can see the
[video](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-319-using-the-ogc-web-processing-service-wps-to-move-business-logic-to-the-server)
and [slides](https://www.ianturton.com/talks/wps/index.html#/step-1)
online (or if you are coming to
[FOSS4GUK](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2019/) in Edinburgh later this
month in person).  The second talk was produced jointly with Andrea
Aime and presented some of our thoughts on some
misconceptions that are persisting in the open source
user community. [The secret life of open source developers

and
[slides](https://www.ianturton.com/talks/developers/index.html#/step-1)
are also available.

The conference was extremely well organised and I must thank the whole of the
[BLOC](https://2019.foss4g.org/about/committees/). For anyone who hasn't been to
FOSS4G recently this is a very big conference there were 1000+ participants from
all over the world and there were 10+ parallel streams of talks over the 3 days
of the conference. To be honest I would prefer to see fewer talks per day and
probably more days, there always seemed to be two (or more) talks on that I
wanted to see, but at least I can review the videos. 
There were some issues but
nothing that was a showstopper, in future probably we shouldn't put one set of
tracks on the 21st floor of the hotel. Note to future organisers having a little ice
cream cart is genius. Finally, I really think venues should pay FOSS4G to visit as a
way of checking if their Wi-Fi really can support 1000 people most of whom have 2
or more devices that need to be on the internet (and downloading large datasets
or code bases) during the opening plenary. 

## Videos of interesting talks

First there was a lot of discussion and interest in the new OGC APIs (they are
all RESTful and JSONy), I'm not sure I really like them but I'm not really a web
guy so I'm probably not the target audience.

+ [Next generation OGC web services with pygeoapi](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-32-next-generation-ogc-web-services-with-pygeoapi)
+ [GeoServer WFS3: introduction to the RESTful, schemaless, JSON first download service](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-243-geoserver-wfs3-introduction-to-the-restful-schemaless-json-first-download-service)

I was interested to see the new features of GeoServer and QGIS:

+ [QGIS is dead, long live QGIS! - the very best new features of QGIS 3.x](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-185-qgis-is-dead-long-live-qgis-the-very-best-new-features-of-qgis-3-x)
+ [PyQGIS the comfortable way - tricks to efficiently work with Python and QGIS](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-183-pyqgis-the-comfortable-way-tricks-to-efficiently-work-with-python-and-qgis)
+ [Standing up a OSM clone with GeoServer and CSS](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-245-standing-up-a-osm-clone-with-geoserver-and-css)

I was sad to miss this talk as I suspect it fits well with what Andrea and I
were saying in our talk:

+ [Open source contributors do more than they should. QGIS as a reference project to find…](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-362-open-source-contributors-do-more-than-they-should-qgis-as-a-reference-project-to-find-sustainable-ways-to-rock-)

And this is a miscellaneous collection of talks that mostly reflect my eclectic
interests left over from various projects I worked on in academia.

+ [From visualization to analysis. Stop using heatmaps to discover spatial patterns](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-420-from-visualization-to-analysis-stop-using-heatmaps-to-discover-spatial-patterns) I was sad this didn't show one of my favourite XKCD cartoons:

![Why Heatmaps are bad!](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heatmap.png "Why Heatmaps are bad!")

 + [Breaking the curse of raster processing software-as-a-service](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-348-breaking-the-curse-of-raster-processing-software-as-a-service)
+ [The return of Crazy Data - Fires in the Amazon forest](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-516-the-return-of-crazy-data-fires-in-the-amazon-forest)
+ [Data Science with OpenStreetMap and Wikidata](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-408-data-science-with-openstreetmap-and-wikidata)
+ [Natural Language Processing meets FOSS4G – Introduction of Document Mapping](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-209-natural-language-processing-meets-foss4g-introduction-of-document-mapping)
+ [Improvements of the Public Safety Map service Using a Chatbot](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-203-improvements-of-the-public-safety-map-service-using-a-chatbot)

## And finally...

As some of my twitter followers already know I did drive all the way to
Bucharest (approximately 2600km) and back again. As a (former) geographer I
really enjoy watching the landscape change, and spotting things like the line in
the Main valley where it is more profitable to put up solar panels rather than
grow grapes, or that in Hungary and Romania they wait until the sweet corn is
completely dry and yellow before harvesting it unlike further north and west
were it is harvested while the leaves are still green. Or where churches switch
from steeples to onion domes.

I also loved the way
Romania was adding infrastructure to it's motorways - it looks like the petrol
station is a pair of standard 40' containers.

So if this whets your appetite for FOSS4G fun then you need to start planning
your trip to [Calgary in 2020](http://2020.foss4g.org/), I have!
