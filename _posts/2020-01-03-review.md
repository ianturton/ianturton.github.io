# Review of 2019 & the decade and a look forward

It seems to be that time of year when everyone writes up a list of their
achievements for the year (and the decade this year). So here I go jumping on
the bandwagon. 

## 2019

Looking back at the year, one thing I don't seem to have done is blog! It seems
I managed to only write one post since 2018. Well there is a reason for this
that we'll get to later. 

### Conferences

We were lucky that this year the main FOSS4G conference was in Europe, so I
drove across Europe to Bucharest, Romania. My one blog post of the year was a
[review](http://127.0.0.1:4000/open-source/2019/09/06/foss4g.html) of the
meeting. Since then I've been amazed to see that more than 3500 people have watched
Andrea Aime and me [rant about community involvement in open source projects](https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-322-the-secret-life-of-open-source-developers). Compare 
that to the 43 people who watched me discussing actual work!

I also got to go to Edinburgh for
[FOSS4G-UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2019/) and present on the WPS work I've
been doing for Astun customers.

### Other Things

Other than work, I spend a lot of time hanging out at [GIS Stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions)
