# Beginners Python Books 

I recently found my self with some time to kill (you don't have to
watch the Tour De France that closely) and as I had a [Python for QGIS](https://astuntechnology.github.io/Python-For-QGIS/)
course coming up for the first time in a year I thought I could use
some revision. I'm not a "native" python writer (lack of types while
liberating is also scary to a Java boy like me), so brushing up on my Python seemed like a good idea. I had recently
bought two new Python books from Manning. [**Tiny Python Projects** by 
Ken Youens-Clark](https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects) and [**Python Workout** by Reuven 
M. Lerner](https://www.manning.com/books/python-workout) and this was an ideal opportunity to read through them.

## Tiny Python Projects
Tiny Python Projects comes as a series of 22 chapters where you build a
new program against a set of unit tests that the author provides via a
git repository. They start off simple hello world program and building
through strings, lists and dictionaries. Then adding functions (and
testing functions) to algorithms and regular expressions to finish up
with a working tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) game. I found this book
great fun to read and in the later chapters to code along to as well. The
emphasis on test driven development is, I think, a really useful process
for new programmers to get used to. All to often I see students (and
others) who write some code and hope that it works but often never check
it (in some cases ever). If I've learnt anything in the 30 odd years I've
been coding it's that with out a test that code is worthless, if only
because when you come back to it the test will remind you how to run it
if nothing else. One of the things that seems to upset new contributors
to GeoServer and GeoTools is our insistence on a test case before we
start to look into their issue, the trouble is that with no test how can
we know if we fixed your problem. So any book which helps to instil this
understanding of the necessity of testing in new coders is great.

The topics covered a wide ranging and while often silly (e.g. spotting
animals from the crows nest) they cover a good depth of python topics
and I think a new python programmer could easily teach themselves how to
produce complex (and correct) programs to could do useful work from this
book. If you plan to go on to use Python in a specific domain then there
would almost certainly be new modules and packages that you would want to
explore and learn but this book would give you the grounding that you'd
need to understand the documentation and examples that this would lead to.

## Python Workout
Python Workout's subtitle is 50 ten-minute exercises, and this gives you
a flavour of the book's contents. As it sounds each chapter is a single
exercise with discussion on the "best" solution and why it is in the
author's opinion the best way of solving it. There are also videos of
the author solving each problem which some might find useful as it does
give an insight into the way that the solution is developed. Most of the
chapters also provide a link to [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/)
which allows you to step through some python code and see what happens
as each line is executed. This tool is new to me but I think I will be
looking at adding it to my teaching in the future.

Again the topics covered in Python Workout start at simple numbers,
strings, lists, dictionaries before more complex functions, functional
programming with comprehensions, modules and packages and finishing up
with creating your own iterators and generators. There is something here
for everyone from beginners to experienced python programmers, and it is all
nicely packaged up to give you a daily workout. The style is less formal that Tiny Python Projects
with less emphasis on writing tests to make sure you have solved the problem but with 
more discussion on how to approach solving the problem. 

## Conclusions

Both of these books would be a great introduction to python to new programmers, and for programmers
who are converting from another language. They provide a clear introduction to the language and the 
features that make python different from (or the same as) other languages, and take you through to the 
complex features that make programming with python fun (and challenging). 

At first sight the books might seem expensive but Manning produce very nice well made physical and electronic 
books and you get the source code too. 
If you by the physical book you get the e-book for free where ever you buy it so you can save on shipping by 
ordering it locally. Also if it looks expensive today, wait a day or two and Manning will almost certainly be having a
40% off sale, or a buy one get one free week or some other deal, I don't think I have ever paid full price for one of
their books.
